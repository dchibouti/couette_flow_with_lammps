## Welcome to couette flow with lammps

The repository contains the work done on computation of Couette flow.

### Definition

In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is the flow of a viscous fluid in the space between two parallel walls, where one of them is moving in x direction. The relative motion of the surfaces imposes a shear stress on the fluid and induces flow. Depending on the definition of the term, there may also be an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction.

In this file Couette ï¬‚ow is described.
