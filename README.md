# couette_flow_with_lammps


The repository contains the work done on computation of Couette flow
# Definition
Couette ﬂow can be described as the ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid between two parallel walls
where one of them is moving in $x direction. 
The ﬂow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the ﬂuid, 
but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the ﬂow direction which is then a case combined with the Poiseuille ﬂow.
In this file only Couette ﬂow is described.
