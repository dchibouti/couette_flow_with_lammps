The repository contains the work done on computation of ***Couette flow***
# Definition

In fluid dynamics, **Couette flow** is the flow of a viscous fluid in the space between two parallel walls, 
where one of them is *moving* in *x* direction. 
The relative motion of the surfaces imposes a shear stress on the fluid and induces flow. Depending on the definition of the term, there may also be an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction.

In this file ***Couette ï¬‚ow*** is described.
